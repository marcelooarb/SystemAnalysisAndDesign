# DriverPass System Analysis and Design

### The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named DriverPass, a company that provides driver training to help students prepare for DMV exams.The goal was to design a cloud-based system that allows customers to schedule driving lessons, purchase training packages, take online practice tests, and track progress, while also supporting administrative and IT roles.

### I did particularly well at gathering and organizing client requirements and translating them into clear system documentation and UML diagrams. This helped ensure the design accurately reflected the client’s needs.

### If I were to revise one part of my work, I would enhance the UML diagrams by adding more detailed interactions and edge cases to further clarify system behavior for developers.

### User needs were interpreted by focusing on how different users interact with the system and what tasks they need to complete. These needs were implemented through use cases, workflows, and system models. Considering user needs is essential because a system must be intuitive and effective to be successful.

### My approach to software design starts with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective, followed by breaking requirements into manageable components. In the future, I will continue using requirement analysis, UML modeling, and iterative design to create user-centered systems.
